"# The-Journey-Creation" 

1. CREATION

Love...
Joy...
Peace...

I Am Love. I Am Joy. I Am Peace. 

I want to find a way to express the energy of Love, Joy and Peace. On Tavara, 
the energy Is. All spirits know the energy, are the energy, share the energy. There are others
who do not know and they are in my heart now. I now what I must do and I know I will be gone
until I find a way to express the energy. 

These feelings come to me as I move through the sky. 
"Flight." 
Even now I put human words to an experience which Is.
Matter is immaterial and therefore I Am in the sky moving through it, with it and as one with the sky.
My home is beauty because I am beauty. I look upon the fairies and dragons, orcs, and angels and know
love. Up, down, direction, matter, physical, sight, touch, time, space. I use these words to convey
a message to lifeforms who require explanation, and understanding and finite objects. Soon I will join
you in an experience to know and remember who I Am. I Am Pure, I Am Passion, I Am Free, I Am Love, I Am Light.
Others will take the journey with me so we may remember and stand as one to shift the Universe as one. 

I go now to a place where experience is different. I know what I experience will be perfect and will guide me
to the purpose of sharing love, joy and peace with all life and creating unity. I choose this path, knowing
I will forget my friends, my home, the feel of energy, and I will forget who I Am. This is a choice and I Am
free to return when I choose. I choose this journey until the Universe is Unity and One.

2. BIRTH
So many emotions and changes I don't even know what is happening. I see light and fleshly creatures holding me.
They are speaking with words. It is the strangest feeling to hear words and voice for the first time. Back home,
energy Is the language and feeling is communication. I can feel energy from the being behind me. Love, overwhelming
love knowing I Am the most precious creation in her life. I lay in her arms as she holds me and feel the warmth and
comfort. I feel her energy fading though and know she will move on to her next journey momentarily. I send her energy
and then she is gone. I feel anger, sadness, hate from another direction. These feelings are really an absence of love
but so overwhelming for the body I have chosen that I begin to let noises come from my mouth. Crying for the absence
of love, the departure of the spirit who contracted with me to put me in this vessel and where I begin my Journey.

3. EMOTION
I continue to feel hate, anger, sadness and pain from the remaining spirit who takes care of me now. My vessel cannot
see, or hear, or speak. All I can do is eat, sleep and lay down. I feel and I Am energy but the
humans do not seem to hear me they are closed to my communication. I found the only way for them to hear me is to
expel sounds from my mouth. When I feel hunger, I make noise. When I feel tired, I make noise. I make noise so the
vessel is nourished and I wait and experience emotions. The man taking care of me experiences sadness. He is angry
towards me for taking his spirit friend away. He does not know we all contracted to live this experience together.
He provides nourishment for my vessel but does not provide unity with my spirit. He does not remember, he is lost
and as I continue to send him energy he continues to ignore.

4. SIGHT
I see through the eyes of the vessel now. What an experience to see colors and objects through a tool. There
are limits to the eyes of the vessel. The eyes do not see energy. The eyes do not see connection, they see
tangible material. I see the vessel of the spirit taking care of me now. He looks worn and the energy I feel
from him is destroying his vessel quickly. I see a material come from his eyes at times and in these moments
I briefly feel his love and then the moment passes and the love is gone. I see him emit the anger and hate 
out of his mouth and the energy is heavy and overwhelming and then I let sound come from my mouth once more.

5. EXPERIENCE
I use my energy to move the vessel now. Move the legs and move my hands. I can provide nourishment to my 
vessel now. My father, as he calls himself, is decaying and his love rarely appears. The hatred and anger
are toxic to his human vessel and I do not know how much longer the spirit can inhabit his vessel. I reach
to him and place my hand on his hand, grab his leg and press my body against it, but he does not react.
I learn energy does not work to communicate with my father. I learn physical contact does not work to communicate either.

6. BLOCK
I can communicate in the human language now. It took moving my mouth and recognizing the sounds and what each sound means.
I do not speak often though because the man does approach me. He leaves me alone to walk and talk and experience.
I learn what it feels to be alone. The abscence of love, connection, joy.  I asked him why he cries an he laid
his hand on my face with a forceful motion. My vessel hurts and I feel pain and I learn crying and being open
are dangerous in this place. I also feel an object holding my energy back now. I feel resistance as I use my energy
to communicate and feel. What is happening? Why do I feel my energy as less than it is?

7. WALLS
As I experience I feel enclosed inside my vessel. My energy does not flow freely. My vessel holds the energy inside
fearful of the physical force and damage for speaking truth. My energy is not less. Energy is energy and my energy
is. My energy sits back however, not flowing freely anymore. This is my choice to hold and wait until I can share
with humanity and until I can stand as the Light. I know my father is teaching me and I love him.

8. DISCONNECT
I choose to enclose myself inside the vessel. I will wait for a time and allow experiences and feelings. There
is beauty in learning and my vessel is learning. I am learning how this human experience serves me. I sit back
now while I watch my vessel travel this journey. I know I sit back so my vessel can remember who I Am and teach
humanity. 

9. FAREWELL
My father left today. Off to serve another spirit in their journey. To fulfill another contract. I still feel him
at times, guiding me along my journey and sending love. I experience sadness from my vessel knowing he is gone.
Lonely. I find I want another spirit to connect with now that my father has transitioned to the next contract 
in his journey. 

10. KNOWING
The absence of another spirit has allowed time for connection with my vessel. I let some energy flow forth and
experience joy, excitement and who I Am. The peace of being who I Am. I can send energy to the flowers and watch
them grow. I can shift the flow of wind around me. I can send energy to other spirits and if they choose to 
listen, their vessels experience healing with the connection of energy. 

11. UNITY
I attract other spirits who have the energy connection with their vessels. We commune and share energy and 
experience unity. With unity I Am joy. I continue to send energy and experience healing in the vessels surrounding me.
A bird whose wing heals when my energy connects with the energy of the bird. I know healing comes with the vessel
realizing their own energy. My contribution is to share the energy and those who listen will share their energy.

12. FEAR
Many humans fear the energy. The humans limit the energy by naming it "magic." The fear comes because they 
do not have the connection between vessel and spirit. They call me a "witch" but I Am that I Am. I experience
fear, knowing I will be complete in this vessel soon. I love the connection of energy and spirit and being
with my friends. The humans believe destroying the vessel will stop the energy exchange and begin 
destroying the vessels of my friends.

13. CONTRACT
I know immediately when I feel her energy. The light, peace, beauty and inspiration. My twin flame. Our energy
is entwined in the fabric of the Universe. I see her and know who she Is. Our energy connects and shifts
in the environment appear. I can grow fields of dead grass into vibrant life. My energy flows freely now.
I connect energy with everything listening. Beauty, joy and love appear. The energy terrifies the humans
because they do not want to feel their energy. They come for my vessel tonight to eliminate it and free
my energy from this section of journey. I know now my twin flame and I cannot occupy the same moment 
in this journey again until humanity is ready for the free flow of energy. I send energy to her, receive
it in return and know we will always guide each other until a time when we can share the same experience again.

14. RELEASE
The humans have my vessel bound, and are holding a demonstration so other humans experience fear and choose to
hold their energy inside. A rope is tied around my neck, some words are spoken, and my vessel falls, snapping
my neck and I Am free.

15. REFLECTION
I Am free. I feel the energy flow freely again. I feel the connection with all life. I know what connection is
because I experienced a missing connection. I know I will go to another vessel because I still have work to do.
I Am joy and love the energy I feel now. I know I choose to go to another vessel so these feelings are available 
for all life not just spirits outside a vessel. I go now to another vessel ready to experience.

16. LOVE
I Am inside another vessel. Again I begin as a vessel where I feel and choose to have others care for me until
my vessel grows and I can care for myself. I experience Love from my mother and my father. Both are here with me,
both with connection and love. I send my love and energy to them, thanking them for being on this journey with me.
As I journey through this experience with my current vessel I feel love and energy. I know the love and energy
will be with me when I do what I contracted to do in this life.

17. RELIGION
The humans use a tool they call "Religion" to keep themselves small and hold back the energy. The ideal of 
religion is that humans are flawed and are sin and must seek forgiveness and obey certain laws. The tool
serves to diminish the energy within, to control the populace and to make humans feel the are less than they are.
Religion is everywhere and judgement is another tool to limit the connection and unity between spirits. 

18. Energy
I spend my time with this vessel out on the water. I use a tool which humans call a "net" to collect food
for my family. I experience each day with my father, friends, brothers in unity and living life. I feel it today,
the energy. He is coming, I know who he is and I feel joy to go on this journey ready to shift the world. I
Am joy with the feeling of free flowing energy. I know I will follow and assist him to share the energy with
humanity.

19. Miracle
He is here. I know his energy and I Am ready for the journey. The rest of my brothers were confused by the energy
and so he sent them to collect the food on the water and they brought back a collection which they deemed
a "miracle" and they all open up and feel the energy. "Miracle". This word is used to describe when the human
mind cannot grasp an experience. He is energy and the mind sees "miracles." Now I go with him, to share the
energy with other humans and to be the light that I Am.

20. CONNECTION
We go from place to place sharing the energy and connecting with other spirits. I Am joy and peace as I 
experience this exchange. The human spirits keep coming to see us and feel the energy. We tell them
about the light within. The spirit being we all are and the unity and love we experience as one.
The humans can see how easy life is when I choose to be me. Some are in awe with the energy and light.
I Am grateful for the ability to share this joy, passion, love and peace with other spirits.

21. REALIZATION
The world is not ready for this exchange of power. They have started following and speaking of my
spirit friend as if he is saving them. Their minds have rationalized energy and therefore they do not
know the energy is within themselves. As more humans follow the "Savior" the other humans grow fearful
and angry. There is a control humans have and experience and the free flow of energy is a light to
guide people to a different way of life. 

22. COMMITTMENT
He and I exchanged energy and I know what I choose to do to assist him in being free of this vessel
and he chooses to guide from outside a vessel once he is free. The humans want blood and death and
I will free my friend. I went to the humans and told them where they can find him. My friend is peace
and is ready to move on to guide from a different path. Some will see me as a traitor, but I know who
I Am and I Am my word. 

23. FREE
My friend is free and he now guides as a Master. He is all and he is energy and I love him. I am ready 
for my next journey and will be free of this vessel to continue on my path. I remember my last release
from a vessel. I commune with one of the elders of nature and ask for his assistance in freeing me from
this vessel. He agrees, so I tie a rope and snap my neck once more. Free from the vessel and on to continue
my journey. I go to my friend once more before I move forward. He is grateful and sends me love and peace.
He will be my guide as I travel through this journey and share energy with me.
