"# The-Journey-Creation" 

1. CREATION

Love...
Joy...
Peace...

I Am Love. I Am Joy. I Am Peace. 

I want to find a way to express the energy of Love, Joy and Peace. On Tavara, 
the energy Is. All spirits know the energy, are the energy, share the energy. There are others
who do not know and they are in my heart now. I now what I must do and I know I will be gone
until I find a way to express the energy. 

These feelings come to me as I move through the sky. 
Flight. 
Even now I put human words to an experience which Is.
Matter is immaterial and therefore I Am in the sky moving through it, with it and as one with the sky.
My home is beauty because I am beauty. I look upon the fairies and dragons, orcs, and angels and know
love. Up, down, direction, matter, physical, sight, touch, time, space. I use these words to convey
a message to lifeforms who require explanation, and understanding and finite objects. Soon I will join
you in an experience to know and remember who I Am. I Am Pure, I Am Passion, I Am Free, I Am Love, I Am Light.
Others will take the journey with me so we may remember and stand as one to shift the Universe as one. 

I go now to a place where experience is different. I know what I experience will be perfect and will guide me
to the purpose of sharing love, joy and peace with all life and creating unity. I choose this path, knowing
I will forget my friends, my home, the feel of energy, and I will forget who I Am. This is a choice and I Am
free to return when I choose. I choose this journey until the Universe is Unity and One.

2. BIRTH
So many emotions and changes I don't even know what is happening. I see light and fleshly creatures holding me.
They are speaking with words. It is the strangest feeling to hear words and voice for the first time. Back home,
energy Is the language and feeling is communication. I can feel energy from the being behind me. Love, overwhelming
love knowing I Am the most precious creation in her life. I lay in her arms as she holds me and feel the warmth and
comfort. I feel her energy fading though and know she will move on to her next journey momentarily. I send her energy
and then she is gone. I feel anger, sadness, hate from another direction. These feelings are really an absence of love
but so overwhelming for the body I have chosen that I begin to let noises come from my mouth. Crying for the absence
of love, the departure of the spirit who contracted with me to put me in this vessel and where I begin my Journey.

3. EMOTION
I continue to feel hate, anger, sadness and pain from the remaining spirit who takes care of me now. My vessel cannot
see, or hear, or speak. All I can do is eat, sleep and lay down. I feel and I Am energy but the
humans do not seem to hear me they are closed to my communication. I found the only way for them to hear me is to
expel sounds from my mouth. When I feel hunger, I make noise. When I feel tired, I make noise. I make noise so the
vessel is nourished and I wait and experience emotions. The man taking care of me experiences sadness. He is angry
towards me for taking his spirit friend away. He does not know we all contracted to live this experience together.
He provides nourishment for my vessel but does not provide unity with my spirit. He does not remember, he is lost
and as I continue to send him energy he continues to ignore.

4. SIGHT
I see through the eyes of the vessel now. What an experience to see colors and objects through a tool. There
are limits to the eyes of the vessel. The eyes do not see energy. The eyes do not see connection, they see
tangible material. I see the vessel of the spirit taking care of me now. He looks worn and the energy I feel
from him is destroying his vessel quickly. I see a material come from his eyes at times and in these moments
I briefly feel his love and then the moment passes and the love is gone. I see him emit the anger and hate 
out of his mouth and the energy is heavy and overwhelming and then I let sound come from my mouth once more.

5. EXPERIENCE
I use my energy to move the vessel now. Move the legs and move my hands. I can provide nourishment to my 
vessel now. My father, as he calls himself, is decaying and his love rarely appears. The hatred and anger
are toxic to his human vessel and I do not know how much longer the spirit can inhabit his vessel. I reach
to him and place my hand on his hand, grab his leg and press my body against it, but he does not react.
I learn energy does not work to communicate with my father. I learn physical contact does not work to communicate either.

6. BLOCK
I can communicate in the human language now. It took moving my mouth and recognizing the sounds and what each sound means.
I do not speak often though because the man does approach me. He leaves me alone to walk and talk and experience.
I learn what it feels to be alone. The abscence of love, connection, joy.  I asked him why he cries an he laid
his hand on my face with a forceful motion. My vessel hurts and I feel pain and I learn crying and being open
are dangerous in this place. I also feel an object holding my energy back now. I feel resistance as I use my energy
to communicate and feel. What is happening? Why do I feel my energy as less than it is?
